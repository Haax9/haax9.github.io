      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little lighter post this time, dealing with connected internet boxes, and specifically the Miami Bboxes (which is a French ISP). Indeed, having one of these boxes, I wondered what I could find from a privacy point of view and what a basic and curious user could do with parameters. We will therefore see here that a certain number of default parameters are activated and that it is possible to act on them. I should point out that no box was mistreated in the context of these experiments : D.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to set up your own website but you are not an expert, you may have seen the word &amp;ldquo;Wordpress&amp;rdquo; spread. It is a CMS (Content Management System) to help in the the creation of a website. Basically, it facilitates creation and management by providing a ready-to-use interface. Now all you have to do is customize your site and write your articles! No need to write code (even if it is possible to search and modify manually) !&lt;/p&gt;
