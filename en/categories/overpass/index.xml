      <description>&lt;p&gt;More than a year ago, I published a first post dedicated to the geolocation of a commercial flight from a photo taken in the plane and based on various research and open source tools. However, other tools exist and are, in my opinion, not enough covered in media. So I thought it would be interesting to write a few lines about them. And then, once again, like a running gag in our discussion groups, a photo also taken from a plane was sent to us. It turns out that this is a perfect case to introduce these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
