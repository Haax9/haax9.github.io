      <description>&lt;p&gt;More than a year ago, I published a first post dedicated to the geolocation of a commercial flight from a photo taken in the plane and based on various research and open source tools. However, other tools exist and are, in my opinion, not enough covered in media. So I thought it would be interesting to write a few lines about them. And then, once again, like a running gag in our discussion groups, a photo also taken from a plane was sent to us. It turns out that this is a perfect case to introduce these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geolocation of a flight from a photo? Let&amp;rsquo;s go for episode 2!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, a good friend sent me a picture taken from a plane for an OSINT/GEOINT challenge. The goal was to find the flight departure, arrival, but also, where the picture was taken. The topic being rather fun and considering the variety of information and skills needed to solve the challenge, I thought it would be interesting to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
