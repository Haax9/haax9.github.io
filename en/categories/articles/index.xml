      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the release of the Windows 10 operating system, many questions about user privacy have been raised. Indeed, even if our data were already collected before, Microsoft has opened their communication on the data collection with Windows 10. It allows mani people to open their eyes and become aware of things happenin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>If you regularly use an Internet browser and you know a little bit about Web technology, you generally know what data is retrieved by the different websites that you visit. If not, just know that each visited website stores information about you through different mechanisms (cookies in particular) which can for example identify you so you no longer have to enter your credentials.
However, this is only a small part of the data that publishers recover.</description>

      <title>Android Internet Box and Privacy - The iceberg summit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little lighter post this time, dealing with connected internet boxes, and specifically the Miami Bboxes (which is a French ISP). Indeed, having one of these boxes, I wondered what I could find from a privacy point of view and what a basic and curious user could do with parameters. We will therefore see here that a certain number of default parameters are activated and that it is possible to act on them. I should point out that no box was mistreated in the context of these experiments : D.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to set up your own website but you are not an expert, you may have seen the word &amp;ldquo;Wordpress&amp;rdquo; spread. It is a CMS (Content Management System) to help in the the creation of a website. Basically, it facilitates creation and management by providing a ready-to-use interface. Now all you have to do is customize your site and write your articles! No need to write code (even if it is possible to search and modify manually) !&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve already heard it thousand times, but questions about passwords on Internet are more than ever critical for your privacy and personal data. Nowadays, Internet is used for (almost) everything and by (almost) everyone, from the simple cooking website to your bank account, through social networks, marketing websites or even your mailboxes. It makes a lot of websites, account, and so, passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
